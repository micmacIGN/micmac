MicMac v2 Python3 API
=====================


Dependencies
------------

As admin:

    apt install python3-pip doxygen pybind11-dev clang-tools llvm-dev

In the Python virtual environment used for compilation:

    pip3 install pybind11 setuptools build

Compilation
-----------

First, compile MMv1 and MMv2.

Then, in 'apib11' directory and the correct Python virtual environment:

    export CC=/usr/bin/clang
    export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
    pip wheel . --no-deps -w dist/

Installation
------------

    pip install --force-reinstall dist/mmvii*.whl

Distribution
------------

The file dist/MMVII-*.whl, created at compilation, can be distributed to machines with same OS, architecture and python version.

This file contains all the necessary files to run the module:
MMVII does not have to be installed on the machine to use the python module.

It can be installed with:

    pip3 install MMVII-*.whl

Upgrade pip if needed:

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip



Usage
-----

```python
    import MMVII
```

The built-in Python help system can be used to have information about the API.

See 'examples' directory for use cases.



Binding Conventions
-------------------
  - implement python binding in a .cpp files that matches th C++ header.<p> (i.e. a binding for a C++ class that is declared in MMVII_MyClass.h we'll be implemented in py_MMVII_MyClass.cpp)
  - class names are the same as in C++ but without the leading 'c'
  - functions, methods, properties are the same as in C++ but with initial letter in lower case (and 'm' removed from class variables names)
